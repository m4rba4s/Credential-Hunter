# Security Policy

## Responsible Use Statement

Enterprise Credential Hunter (ECH) is a powerful security tool designed for legitimate red team operations, penetration testing, and digital forensics. Users must adhere to ethical guidelines and legal requirements.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in ECH, please follow responsible disclosure:

1. **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue
2. Email details to: security@ech-enterprise.com
3. Include:
   - Detailed description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Investigation**: 1-7 days
- **Fix Development**: 1-14 days depending on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: 30-90 days after fix release

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

- **Anti-Analysis**: Detects debugging and analysis attempts
- **Code Obfuscation**: Runtime polymorphism and mutation
- **Memory Protection**: Secure allocators and cleanup
- **Network Obfuscation**: Traffic masking capabilities
- **Artifact Cleanup**: Automatic evidence removal

### Secure Development Practices

- Static analysis with Clippy and security lints
- Dependency auditing with cargo-audit
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- Memory-safe Rust implementation
- Regular third-party security reviews

## Threat Model

### Threats Addressed

1. **EDR/AV Detection**: Advanced evasion techniques
2. **Network Monitoring**: Traffic obfuscation and stealth
3. **Memory Analysis**: Anti-debugging and protection
4. **Forensic Analysis**: Artifact cleanup and obfuscation

### Threats NOT Addressed

- Physical security attacks
- Social engineering (outside tool scope)
- Zero-day vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Nation-state level advanced persistent threats

## Security Configuration

### Recommended Settings

```toml
[stealth]
level = "High"
enable_edr_evasion = true
enable_memory_protection = true
cleanup_on_exit = true

[detection]
sensitivity = "Paranoid"
anti_debugging = true
vm_detection = true
```

### High-Security Environment

For maximum operational security:

1. Use air-gapped systems for development
2. Enable all stealth and evasion features
3. Use VPN/Tor for network operations
4. Implement proper OPSEC procedures
5. Regular credential rotation

## Compliance and Legal

### Regulatory Compliance

- **GDPR**: Implements data protection measures
- **HIPAA**: Healthcare data protection capabilities
- **SOX**: Financial data security controls
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card data protection

### Legal Considerations

**IMPORTANT**: Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with:

- Local and international laws
- Organizational policies
- Industry regulations
- Ethical hacking guidelines

### Authorization Requirements

Before using ECH, ensure you have:

- Written permission from system owners
- Proper scope definition and limitations
- Legal review of testing activities
- Incident response procedures in place

## Security Hardening

### Build Security

```bash
# Security-focused build
cargo build --release --profile stealth

# With additional hardening
RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+crt-static" cargo build --release
```

### Runtime Security

1. **Privilege Management**: Run with minimal required privileges
2. **Network Isolation**: Use isolated network segments
3. **Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging
4. **Monitoring**: Implement real-time security monitoring

### Deployment Security

- Use container isolation when possible
- Implement network segmentation
- Regular security updates and patches
- Secure configuration management

## Incident Response

### If Compromised

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Activate incident response team
   - Document timeline and actions

2. **Investigation**:
   - Analyze attack vectors
   - Assess data exposure
   - Identify root causes
   - Implement containment measures

3. **Recovery**:
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Update security controls
   - Conduct lessons learned
